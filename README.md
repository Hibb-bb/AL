AL (Associated Learning, [ICLR 2022](https://in.ncu.edu.tw/~hhchen/academic_works/wu22-associated.pdf) and [NECO 2021](https://github.com/SamYWK/Associated_Learning)) decomposes a neural network's layers into small components such that **each component has a local objective function**.  As a result, **each layer can be trained independently and simultaneously** (in a pipeline fashion).  AL's predictive power is comparable to (and frequently better than) end-to-end backpropagation.

Code will be available soon after my military service(which ends around 6/1 I hope), sorry guys!
